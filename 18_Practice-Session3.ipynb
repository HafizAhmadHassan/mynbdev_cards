    "In this video, I explain image classification from scratch and show how to build a custom model with PyTorch code. Then, I demonstrate how to simplify the model by using the fastai library. Finally, I introduce the ResNet architecture and rebuild our model with it. This process gives us insight into building models for image classification tasks from start to finish while exploring different architectures along the way.\n",
