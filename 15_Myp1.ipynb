    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Letter Grade Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "According to IB Grading Rule\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Students are expected to participate in all online activities as listed on the course calendar. _Enter specifics regarding attendance policy here._\n",
    "\n",
    "If you monitor, track, and/or score student participation, explain how you will keep track and how often students should be accessing the course. If appropriate, mention that you will be using Managbac tracking tool, discussions, chat sessions, and group work, to monitor their participation in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build Rapport\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let your instructor know as early as possible.

Make sure that you are proactive in informing your instructor when difficulties arise during the semester so that we can help you find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Assignments\n",
    "\n",

Extensions will not be given beyond the next assignment except under extreme circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "All discussion assignments must be completed by the assignment due date and time. Late or missing discussion assignments will lower your grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understand When You May Drop This Course\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the student's responsibility to understand when they need to consider disenrolling from a course. Refer to the MPC Course Schedule for dates and deadlines for registration. After this period, a serious and compelling reason is required to drop from the course.

Students are expected to follow the classroom rules established by the instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheating may be any one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unauthorized looking at or procuring information from any unauthorized sources or from another student's work during an examination or from any work that will be graded or given points.\n",
    "2. Unauthorized acquiring, reading or learning of test questions prior to the testing date and time.\n",
    "3. Changing any portion of a returned graded test or report and resubmitting it as an original work to be regraded.\n",
    "4. Presenting the work of another as one's own for a grade or points.\n",
    "5. Knowingly assisting another student in cheating.\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is not all-inclusive and the list itself is not meant to limit the definition of cheating to just these items mentioned.\n",

    "#### Consequences of Academic Dishonesty\n",
    "\n",
    "The disciplinary action for cheating or plagiarism is up to the discretion of the instructor. The instructor may select one or more of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Issue an oral or written notification and warn the student that further acts of this sort will result in additional disciplinary action.\n",
    "2. Issue an \"NP\" or a failing grade (\"F\") or \"0\" for the assignment in question.\n",
    "3. Refer the student to the Vice President for Student Services for disciplinary action."
