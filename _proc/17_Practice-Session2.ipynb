    "The goal of this project is to build a cat family classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the Fast.ai library. This model will be able to accurately classify between lion, tiger, cougar, caracal, cheetah and ocelot images. We will use transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet34 architecture as our base for training the model on our dataset of cats from each species in order to achieve high accuracy results quickly and efficiently.\n",
