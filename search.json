Late or missing discussion assignments will lower your grade.\n\n\n\nIt is the student’s responsibility to understand when they need to consider disenrolling from a course. Refer to the MPC Course Schedule for dates and deadlines for registration. After this period, a serious and compelling reason is required to drop from the course. Serious and compelling reasons includes: (1) documented and significant change in work hours, leaving student unable to attend class, or (2) documented and severe physical/mental illness/injury to the student or student’s family.\n\n\n\nUnder emergency/special circumstances, students may petition for an incomplete grade.

Work performed on examinations or other forms of evaluation must represent an individual’s own work, knowledge and experience of the subject matter. Students are expected to follow the classroom rules established by the instructor.\nCheating may be any one of the following:\n\nUnauthorized looking at or procuring information from any unauthorized sources or from another student’s work during an examination or from any work that will be graded or given points.\nUnauthorized acquiring, reading or learning of test questions prior to the testing date and time.\nChanging any portion of a returned graded test or report and resubmitting it as an original work to be regraded.\nPresenting the work of another as one’s own for a grade or points.\nKnowingly assisting another student in cheating.\n\nThis list is not all-inclusive and the list itself is not meant to limit the definition of cheating to just these items mentioned.\n\n\n\nThe disciplinary action for cheating or plagiarism is up to the discretion of the instructor. The instructor may select one or more of the following options:\n\nIssue an oral or written notification and warn the student that further acts of this sort will result in additional disciplinary action.\nIssue an “NP” or a failing grade (“F”) or “0” for the assignment in question.\nRefer the student to the Vice President for Student Services for disciplinary action.",

Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty.\nPlagiarism may be any one of the following:\n\nVerbatim copying without proper documentation of the source(s).\nParaphrasing without proper documentation of the source(s).\nUnacknowledged appropriation of information or ideas from someone else.\nCopying Someones code\n\nIf students have any questions about these forms of plagiarism or about an assignment they are preparing, they should ask their instructor for clarification rather than risk unintentional plagiarism.\n\n\n\nIt is important for students to act in an honest and trustworthy manner. Work performed on examinations or other forms of evaluation must represent an individual’s own work, knowledge and experience of the subject matter. Students are expected to follow the classroom rules established by the instructor.\nCheating may be any one of the following:\n\nUnauthorized looking at or procuring information from any unauthorized sources or from another student’s work during an examination or from any work that will be graded or given points.\nUnauthorized acquiring, reading or learning of test questions prior to the testing date and time.\nChanging any portion of a returned graded test or report and resubmitting it as an original work to be regraded.\nPresenting the work of another as one’s own for a grade or points.\nKnowingly assisting another student in cheating.\n\nThis list is not all-inclusive and the list itself is not meant to limit the definition of cheating to just these items mentioned.\n\n\n\nThe disciplinary action for cheating or plagiarism is up to the discretion of the instructor. The instructor may select one or more of the following options:\n\nIssue an oral or written notification and warn the student that further acts of this sort will result in additional disciplinary action.\nIssue an “NP” or a failing grade (“F”) or “0” for the assignment in question.\nRefer the student to the Vice President for Student Services for disciplinary action.",
